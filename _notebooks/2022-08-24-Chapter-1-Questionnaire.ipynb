        "> **The first theoretical misunderstanding came from the global academic community who essentially gave up on neural networks.  This happened because of the misunderstanding of the book *Perceptrons* (MIT Press) by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.  Minsky and Papert showed that that a single layer of perceptrons was unable to learn some simple but critical mathematical functions(such as XOR).  This is what the community took away from the book, what they missed was that Minsky and Papert in the book showed that using multiple layers of the perceptrons would allow these limitations to be addressed.**\n",

        " >**The second theoretical misunderstanding came from the implementation of neural networks.  In theory, adding just one extra layer of neurons was enough to allow any mathematical function was enough to allow any mathematical function to be approximated with these neural networks, but in practice such networks were often too big and too slow to be useful.**\n",
