        "5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?\n",
        "> **The first theoretical misunderstanding came from the global academic community who essentially gave up on neural networks.  This happened because of the misunderstanding of the book *Perceptrons* (MIT Press) by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.  Minsky and Papert showed that that a single layer of perceptrons was unable to learn some simple but critical mathematical functions(such as XOR).  This is what the community took away from the book, what they missed was that Minsky and Papert in the book showed that using multiple layers of the perceptrons would allow these limitations to be addressed.**\n",
        "\n",
        " >**The second theoretical misunderstanding came from the implementation of neural networks.  In theory, adding just one extra layer of neurons was enough to allow any mathematical function was enough to allow any mathematical function to be approximated with these neural networks, but in practice such networks were often too big and too slow to be useful.**\n",

        ">**When we write a regular program, we are able to think about the process to complete the task and then translate them into code. We would need to tell the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem in detail. Recognizing objects in a photo is tricky. What are the steps that we need to recognize an object in a picture?**\n",
        "11. What did Samuel mean by \"weight assignment\"?\n",
        ">**Samuel means that by \"weight assignment\" they are variables and we can assign values to them.  These weights are the program's values that define how the program will operate.**\n",
        "12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called \"weights\"? \n",
        ">**What Samuel called \"weights\" are generally referred to as model *parameters.* The term *weight* now is reserved for a particular type of model parameter.**\n",

        "14.Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
        ">**It is hard because it is not obvious what the deep model looks like for any given problem such as vision.  This is in contrast to a checkers program where we have strategies encoded, search mechanism, and varied weights depending on the move and checkerboard area.**\n",
        "15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n",
        ">**The *universal approximation theorem* shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory.**\n",

        "  *   **A model cannot be created without data.**\n",
        "  *   **A model can learn to operate on only the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.** \n",
        "  *   **This learning approach creates only *predictions*, not recommended *actions*.**\n",
        "  *   **It not enough to have just examples of input data.  We need *labels* for that data.  This means we need to have a label on each picture telling the computer what it is, such as picture of a cat labeled as a cat or dog picture labeled as a dog.**\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?\n",
        "> **A *positive feedback loop* can impact the rollout of a predictive policing model.  When the model gets used more, the more biased the data becomes.  This causes the model to be more biased and the pattern repeats.  For example, a *predictive policing* model is made based on historical arrests.  This is not predicting crime but rather predicting arrests.  Law enforcement then use this model to focus on those areas predicted by the model thereby increasing arrests.  The additional arrests feedback into the model and makes the model more bias.**\n",
        "18. Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?\n",
        "> **224x244 is the standard size for historical reasons(old pretrained models require this size), but you can use any size.  IF you increase the size, you will often get a model with better results.  This is because the model has more details to focus on.  The downside of doing this causes the training to slow and increase memory consumption.  The opposite is true if the images are smaller.**\n",
        "19. What is the difference between classification and regression?\n",
        "   * **A *classification* model is a model that attempts to predict a class or category.  It's predicting from a number of discrete possiblities, such as \"dog\" or \"cat\".**\n",
        "   * **A *regression model* is a model that attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as temperature or a location.**\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n",
        " * **A *validation set* is a set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is.  Since we see the validation set, we can indirectly influence the model as we explore and adjust hyperparameter values.  This has the potential to allow for overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.**\n",
        " * **A *test set* is another level of highly reserved data.  This is different from the validation set because it is not used to improve the model. The test data needs to be totally hidden and is only used to evaluate the model at the very end.**  \n",
