The pad, pads the images with zeros(black) leading to empty space which wastes computations for our model.  The squish or stretch may cause the image to end up as unrealistic shapes, leading the model to learn that things look different from how they actually are.  In practice we randomly select part of the image and then crop to just that part.  On each epoch(one complete pass through all of the images in the dataset), we randomly select a different part of the image.  This causes our model to learn to focus on, and recognize, different features in our images.  It also reflects how images work in the real world: different photos of the same thing may be framed in slightly different ways.*\n",

Untrained neural networks knows nothing about how images behave.  It doesn’t even recognize that when an object is rotated by one degree, it is still a picture of the same thing!  Training a neural network with examples of images in which the objects are in slightly different places and are slightly different sizes helps it understand the basic concept of what an object is, and how it can be represented in an image.*"
